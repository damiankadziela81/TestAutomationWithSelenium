# TestAutomationWithSelenium

## Overview
My educational program written in Java using Selenium WebDriver for test automation using Page Object Model with Page Factory patterns.

It currently includes 3 test cases and several examples of exceptions you can come across while automating web interactions with Selenium.

I will be adding more test cases to the second Store page.  

## Testing pages
Login and exceptions:

Store practice page:
http://146.59.32.4/index.php

## Browser
Chrome, you can however swap the driver and use it with ohter browsers.
